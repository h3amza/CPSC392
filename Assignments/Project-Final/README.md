## CPSC 392
## Introduction to Data Science
## Final Project Write-up
## Due: May 22nd, 2020 11:59pm

#### 8-10 pages. 12pt font size. 1.5 line spacing

You will submit a write up along with your code, as your final project submissions. The main sections that you should include in the document should be:

- #### Abstract
	- This is a 100-150 word summary of your project. It usually includes what your research question is, and what results you have found for it.

- #### Introduction/Project Overview and Motivation
	- Here you will introduce the problem you are trying to answer and your motivation behind choosing this project. You can use this section to explain background information necessary to understand the research question and your application.

- #### Data
	- Using visualizations, here you describe what your data looks like. This is where results of your exploratory data analysis should be described.

- #### Methodology
	- You will use this section to describe the methods you apply on the data to get results. You can describe what models you have used and any transformations you had to do on the data.

- #### Results
	- In this section, you will present your observations and findings.

- #### Conclusion and Future Applications
	- Summarize your findings and describe how your analysis can be used in future applications.

The research project is 15% of your final grade. Of which, 10% will be based on your project documentation and 5% for your presentations.

For the write-up, I expect professional documentation with visualizations added as needed. If someone does not have access to your code or your presentation, this document should be sufficient in explaining all aspects of your project.

Overall, I am looking to see a report that neatly tells a story of your quest to answer your research question. I don't want to see blocks of code copied and pasted, or the document being overloaded with graphs. I would like to see a clear and concise explanation of every step you have taken to get the results that you did, a selected few visualizations that stand out and explain a particular aspect of the project, and a logical explanation why you selected the models that you did, and how they work with answering your research question. This is the rubric I will be using to grade this document.
