## Project Deliverable 2
## Due: April 26th, 2020 11:59pm

It has been a month since you proposed your projects. I would like to check in and see what progress you have made so far. 

Please submit a document that details your final questions you are asking from the data and the algorithms you are going to apply to get the answers. It doesn't need to be a lengthy document, I just want to make sure that you are using the right algorithms to answer your questions, and if I can help out in any way.

What I am expecting to see as a final product at the end of the semester is that:
* You applied exploratory data analysis techniques to clean and prune unwanted data points from your data. This includes application of PCA if you have too many features and random sampling of your data if it is too big.
* You selected at least 3 different machine algorithms to answer your question. You could have 1 main question you are trying to answer, but can have a few minor questions that will help you answer the main one. If you are using data with classification, I would love to see application of clustering algorithms to see what kind of hidden features there are in your data.
* You used train/test splits, k-fold cross validation, and multiple iterations to get robust accuracy from your models.
* You used at least 5 visualizations to convey your results and your application of the algorithms. Make sure that the visualizations are relevant to your question and are able to hold their own without explaining in writing what they show.
* Make sure to document everything you do as there will be a final write-up required as your submission, along with your code. I will provide more details in the next couple of weeks.

Submit your Project Deliverable 2 via Blackboard as a PDF document by April 26th, 2020.
