## Introduction to Data Science
## Project Deliverable 1
## Due: March 29th, 2020 11:59pm

This is the first of a few deliverable for your final project. The first phase consists of you deciding on a data set and the question you want to answer using the techniques we have used in this class so far. You are welcome to choose the data from an area of your interest, but I am also listing some resources where you can find interesting data sets. You are not allowed to use any data sets that we already used in class as examples. 

Think back to our very first lecture on the data science process. You may begin by asking an interesting and finding relevant for it, to answer it. Or, you can find an interesting data set and explore it in hopes that you come up with interesting questions for it. It could related to detecting handwritten digits using the MNIST data, or trying to predict the happiness of a song using Spotify data, or finding factors that most impact the chances of diabetes in a patient.

Please remember that you cannot use a data set that another student has already picked. I am linking a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CFrTC87G3LfmHEm74Ber4IFKI9GXHSu8cF2_9lPEI6I/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use to broadcast your selection. Enter your name, current date and time, and the data set (with a link) you are planning on using. If the data set you want to use has already been taken, you will have to choose another data set. So choose early!

Here are a few resources that you can use to find a data set:

* [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [FiveThirtyEight Repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)

By March 29th, I want you to submit your project proposal via Blackboard. It should be a single paragraph that details the data you are going to use and the question you are going to answer, using that data. Add a project title, and a link to the data set (if available online) and you should be good to go.
