Let's get more practice exploring data! The NBA-Elo dataset contains information about all NBA games played in 2015. The The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players or teams, and have proved to be very consistent in predicting the outcome of basketball games. You can read FiveThirtyEight's article about how they calculate it here:

* [How We Calculate Elo Ratings](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/)

We will look at how to check the accuracy of this predictor in the coming weeks, but for now, let's get to know everything there is to know about the data. Using the exploring techniques we have used in class, conduct an exploratory data analysis on this data. This includes reporting missing values and outliers, classifying numerical and categorical attributes, and plotting different combination of attributes to visualize relationships.

Make sure to write a detailed report that includes your findings and plots that you think are important to be aware of before diving into predictive algorithms. You may either submit a Jupyter notebook with your comments and code or a combination of a PDF and Python code for this assignment. Submissions can be made through Blackboard. Remember to add a README to your compressed folder.
