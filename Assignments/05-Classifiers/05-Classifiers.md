Using iris dataset, find the best classifier from k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees using the built-in functions in the sci-kit learn library. You are to use a training testing split of 80/20, and should report the accuracy score for each and say which one is best. 

Next, you will add a note about what the advantages and disadvantages of each classifier are.


Present your code, findings, comments, and plots in a  Jupyter notebook file. Don't forget to attach a README with your code files and submit a compressed folder to Blackboard before 2:30pm on 3rd April, 2020.
